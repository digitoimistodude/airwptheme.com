    <h2>Why Air?</h2>

        <h3>Fully accessible</h3>
        <p>Accessibility (a11y) has always been one of our core values when it comes to development. Air-light has built in accessible navigation patterns for screen readers but also tools for accessible development like <a href="https://github.com/YozhikM/stylelint-a11y">stylelint-a11y</a>. Say no to inaccessible web!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>Ultra minimal</h3>
        <p>CSS weights only 13 KB and JavaScript 7.8 KB. This means faster loading times, because there is no excess code.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>Custom Post Support</h3>
        <p>CPTs and taxonomies are our daily bread. That's why they are included so that adding them is easiest thing ever.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>Full support for ACF and Gutenberg</h3>
        <p>With Air it's very easy to create custom elements with Advanced Custom Fields and Gutenberg. The theme even has a boilerplate for creating modular flexible elements.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>No CSS frameworks languages</h3>
        <p>Forget Bootstrap, Bulma, Foundation and Tailwind. CSS is not hard. Air-light has only the necessary elements like typography, forms and buttons, nothing excess. Create your own CSS framework with Air-light!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>No PHP templating languages</h3>
        <p>No "fancy" templating in the way. Code WordPress like you are used to with traditional PHP. We only used Namespaced PHP, but that's it!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>No features you never use</h3>
        <p>We have disabled widgets, post formats, Jetpack support, (Threaded) comments, Underscores Template tags and sidebar from our theme. These are almost never needed and just add extra weight.</p>
